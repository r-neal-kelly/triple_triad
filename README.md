* The goal is to turn other cards into your color!
* Whoever has the **most cards** at the end of the match wins.
* If the top two players have the same amount of cards, the match ends in a **draw**.
* Each card has **4 numbers** located in the top-left face of the card. In addition to numbers 1 through 9, the letter A represents the number 10.
* There is one number for **each side** of the card, i.e. left, top, right, and bottom.
* When you place a card next to another card, it will change into your color if your card has a **higher number** on the touching side.

## Optional Rules

### Same
The same rule applies when **2 or more** sides of your card are the **same** as those of your opponents' adjacent cards. You get to take **each card that is**!

### Plus
The plus rule applies when **2 or more** sides of your card and your opponents' adjacent cards **add up to the same sum**. You get to take **each card that does**!

### Wall
The wall rule causes the **edge of the board** to equate to A, which will count as **1 of the 2** needed sides to trigger the same and plus rule!

### Combo
The combo rule applies **after same or plus** and triggers each taken card as if you had **just placed it on the board**, allowing for a **chain**. The change can **continue** if another same or plus rule applies and ends whenver it doesn't. With this rule, it's possible to **take the entire board**!
